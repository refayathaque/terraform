# Terraform

Infrastructure as Code.    
Automation of your infrastructure.  
Keep your infrastructure in a certain state (compliant).  
-E.g., 2 web instances w/ 2 volumes, and 1 load balancer.  
Make your infrastructure auditable.  
-Keep your infrastructure change history in version control (b/c it's infrastructure as code).  
Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack have a focus on automating installation and configuration of software.  
-Keeping the machines in compliance, in a certain state.  
Terraform can automate provisioning of the infrastructure itself.  
-E.g., using AWS, GCP, Azure, etc. APIs.  
-Works well with automation software like Ansible to install software after the infrastructure is provisioned.
